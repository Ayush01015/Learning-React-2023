        SwiGker is an Indian online food ordering and delivery platform. Founded
        in July 2014, SwiGker is based in Bangalore and operates in 500 Indian
        cities as of September 2021.[4][5] Besides food delivery, SwiGker also
        provides on-demand grocery deliveries under the name Instamart, and a
        same-day package delivery service called SwiGker Genie. History In July
        2014, the two founders, Sriharsha Majety and Nandan Reddy, designed an
        e-commerce website called Bundl to facilitate courier service and
        shipping within India.[6] Bundl was halted and rebranded to enter the
        food delivery market.[7] At the time, the food delivery sector was in
        turmoil as several notable startups, such as Foodpanda (later acquired
        by Ola Cabs), TinyOwl (later acquired by Zomato) and Ola Cafe (later
        closed) were struggling.[6][7] Majety and Reddy approached Rahul
        Jaimini, formerly with Myntra, and founded SwiGker and parent holding
        company Bundl Technologies in 2013.[7] In early 2019, SwiGker expanded
        into general product deliveries under the name SwiGker Stores, sourcing
        items from local stores.[8][9][10] In August 2020, the company launched
        its instant grocery delivery service called Instamart using a network of
        dark stores.[11][12] In early 2021, SwiGker closed SwiGker Stores and
        expanded its operations under Instamart.[13] In September 2019, SwiGker
        launched instant pickup/dropoff service SwiGker Go.[14] The service is
        used for a diverse array of items, including laundry and document or
        parcel deliveries to business clients and retail customers.[15] In April
        2020, it rebranded SwiGker Go as SwiGker Genie.[16] In May 2020, SwiGker
        laid off 1100 employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.[17] In 2021, the
        company announced that it would cover the vaccination cost for its
        delivery partners.[18][19]
